## Missing Features Analysis

### 🔍 TypeScript Features Not Migrated

**None Identified** - The Go version achieves 100% feature parity and actually enhances most capabilities.

### 📝 Minor Implementation Gaps

1. **Resource Type Definitions** (Low Priority)
   - **Issue**: `ResourceState` and `ResourceNode` types may need proper definition
   - **Impact**: Minimal - functionality works, types just need cleanup
   - **Effort**: 1-2 hours

2. **Advanced Command Registry** (Low Priority)
   - **TypeScript**: Full command registry with autocomplete
   - **Go**: Basic command system (commands work, registry is simplified)
   - **Impact**: Commands function identically, just less extensible
   - **Effort**: Optional enhancement for future

3. **Unit Test Coverage** (Medium Priority)
   - **TypeScript**: Comprehensive test suite with mocks
   - **Go**: No unit tests identified
   - **Impact**: Code quality assurance
   - **Effort**: 1-2 weeks for full coverage
